The cutlery and glasses are arranged airline-style on a neat wooden tray (there’s even a little paper bag, containing rye crackers) but not much room for anything else.</p>\n<p>The restaurant has been chosen for its convenience — Salonen is staying at the Grand — but this cramped arrangement must be soothingly familiar for the jet-setting conductor.</p>\n<p>Salonen was 34 in 1992 when he was appointed music director of the LA Philharmonic (where he stayed until 2009.) Feted for his interpretations of 20th-century and contemporary works, and, increasingly, his own compositions, he is attracting new audiences to classical music through his enthusiasm for technology. Two years ago, as principal conductor of the London Philharmonia, he launched the Orchestra app, a high- tech introduction to the workings of an orchestra and the role of a conductor. Earlier this year, he starred in one of the latest <a title=\"Esa-Pekka Salonen in ad for iPad\" href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_4msNKgRQDc\">Apple iPad adverts</a>, a stylish promotion that attracted 100,000 YouTube views within the first 24 hours.</p>\n<p>The 56-year-old Finn is now one of the most powerful figures in the global classical music industry but maintains strong connections with Helsinki, where he was brought up (and where his mother still lives). Each year he returns to the region for the Baltic Sea Festival, an event he founded, and we are meeting on the day of its opening 2014 concert.</p>\n<p>Settling into his seat, Salonen declines a glass of wine — he has a rehearsal to go to — so we stick to sparkling water, and are steered towards the special: a salad of king crab and trout roe with leaves and crispy fried onions in a rich vinaigr­ette. The price suggests a substantial main course but the dishes here are a little smaller than usual, the waiter explains, so if we’re still hungry we can easily order more.</p>\n<p>There’s a laid-back air about Salonen: his speech has a Nordic lilt with an occasional US twang (he and his family — his wife is the violinist Jane Price, and the couple has three children — are based in Los Angeles) and his face creases into an ambiguous half-smile. But every now and then you catch a flicker of disarming intensity. We’ve been talking about the Baltic Sea Festival and Salonen’s friend, fellow superstar conductor and festival co-founder Valery Gergiev. “I’ve spent the morning defending my friend Valery before the Swedish media,” says Salonen.</p>\n<p>Gergiev is a committed supporter of the Putin regime, and his appearance at the festival provoked some outrage in Stockholm at a time of strained diplomacy. Salonen describes his opinions as “diametrically opposite” to his colleague’s on the subject of Ukraine but, “as long as London is making money for the oligarchs, as long as the Austrians are lobbying for a gas pipe to make sure they get an uninterrupted supply, regardless of what’s happening to Ukraine,” he says, “why should I, as the artistic director of this festival, not say that Gergiev is allowed to come here?”</p>\n<p>He’s in full flow now. “Many of my colleagues say, ‘Well, you know, music is above or beyond politics,’ ” he continues. “I have the opposite view. I would very much like to be in the centre of the political debate. And I think one of the problems of classical music, or whatever you call it, is that we have been marginalised as part of the uppermost crust of society. We play our Mozarts and our Beethovens, and it’s quite pretty and it doesn’t annoy anybody.”</p>\n<p><span class=\"ft-bold\">. . .</span>\n</p>\n<aside data-asset-type=\"pullQuote\" data-asset-name=\"asset1\"></aside><p>At the opening concert later that evening, as well as Shostakovich’s Fourth Symphony, Salonen is to conduct the prologue from the composer’s unfinished opera <span class=\"ft-italic\">Orango</span>, a work Salonen premiered with the LA Philharmonic in 2011. It’s a wild piece of music and the narrative, about a half-ape, half-man, satirises the early 1930s Soviet government. Shostakovich, perhaps fearing repercussions, gave up on the project, and <span class=\"ft-italic\">Orango</span> survived as nothing more than a myth until 2004, when a score was discovered in the basement of Moscow’s Glinka Museum, which houses a collection of rare and valuable instruments. Even then, it took some time for word to get around.</p>\n<p>“A few years later I’m in Chicago,” Salonen explains, in between mouthfuls, “having dinner with [composer] Gerard McBurney and I ask him what he’s doing and he says, ‘Well, you know, I’m orchestrating <span class=\"ft-italic\">Orango</span>’ . . . . I said, ‘Holy shit, you told me nothing?’ — ah, this crab is beautiful,” he adds, digging a fork into a fragile salad, a sort of elaborate amuse-bouche. “He said he didn’t think I’d be interested. I said, ‘I am, can you plug me in?’ So he called Irina Shostakovich — his widow — and she was very happy because she wanted the first performance to be in the west, and that’s how it happened.”</p>\n<p>Salonen muses on the contemporary parallels. When <span class=\"ft-italic\">Orango</span> appears, King Kong-like, outside the Soviet palace, he becomes aggressive and the crowd grows fearful. “They start shouting, ‘Shoot it, shoot it dead,’ and then the Entertainer, who’s a sort of programme host — an Anderson Cooper-type — says, ‘Armed conflict and violence is an old-fashioned idea, I strongly believe in diplomacy.’ I’m quoting verbatim,” Salonen says. “There’s beauty in this but I’m sad that it’s this acute.”</p>\n<p>He admits the festival was conceived in happier times, when environmental challenges were the chief concern. Back in the 1970s, Salonen was taken by his father, a keen naturalist, to Finland’s outer islands, where they observed the harmful effects of the pesticide DDT on the Arctic flora. And it hit home again in 1999, when he and his family witnessed one of the first major explosions of blue-green algae in the Baltic Sea while holidaying at their summer house in southern Finland. “The Gulf became a porridge, unbelievable, like a kind of moss growing — an extraordinary colour, a sickly colour — it scares the hell out of you,” he says. It was this alarming event, coupled with a powerful sense of the region’s shared history, that inspired the first festival in 2003.</p>\n<p>“There are a couple of difficult borders — Nato and non-Nato, EU and non-EU. My thought was we should try to ignore these borders and look at it as a cultural and historic region that has had a lot in common over the years,” he says. “[Although] it’s anyone’s guess if you can say there’s any kind of Baltic identity in terms of music-making or music composition. I’m not sure about that.”</p>\n<p>I swipe open my phone to show him a graphic I’d seen on Twitter, illustrating the global concentration of heavy-metal bands. “We win, I think. Yeah — yup!” he says studying the red heat-map glowing over this part of the world.</p>\n\n<p>\n</p>\n\n<p>So how do you explain that?</p>\n<p>“I think there’s something about that particular expression that suits us, the darkness, violence, and yet you see these guys with their memorabilia and paraphernalia, tattoos and studs and stuff, and there’s this margin of piss-take,” he replies.</p>\n<p>It strikes me that Salonen’s trademark look — black T-shirt, black cotton biker jacket, discreet goatee — is not entirely unrelated. Though cleaner-cut, of course. “You see these grossly overweight 60-year-olds wearing Satanist T-shirts and beards and studs,” he laughs. “There’s something terribly sweet about that.” And as it happens, he’s something of a metal fan himself.</p>\n<p>“My eldest daughter is into that world — noise and heavy metal, she’s composing noise herself — and I thought, ‘OK, it’s not my cup of tea but I need to know something about it’, so I listen to [Swedish death metal band] Meshuggah, some Finnish metal bands, Polish bands,” he says. “It’s great after concerts, actually — you can have a drink or two, listen to some heavy metal and it really wipes the slate clean.”</p>\n<p><span class=\"ft-bold\">. . .</span>\n</p>\n<aside data-asset-type=\"promoBox\" data-asset-name=\"asset2\"></aside><p>Our plates are cleared and our attention drifts back to the menu. Salonen insists I must try some salmon — terrific here, apparently — but it’s not on today’s menu so he orders the steamed cod to share (at the waiter’s suggestion), which is presented a few minutes later, together with an earnest description. “Have you noticed in these sort of places they leave out the [definite] article when they mention the chef: ‘chef thinks . . . ’ or ‘this is bread from chef’s childhood,’ ” he says, conspiratorially, before offering me a helping of tender fish and creamy sauce.</p>\n<p>Conversation turns to his student days at the Sibelius Academy in Helsinki where he trained in the traditions of European modernism. Entering at 15, he studied the French horn and composition, and, along with contemporaries including the composers Magnus Lindberg and Kaija Saariaho, formed an avant-garde music group called Korvat Auki! (Ears Open!). As a student he loathed the cult of the superstar conductor, and even now he scoffs at the recollection of Herbert von Karajan, considered by many to be its apogee, dressed in tight-fitting motorbike leathers on the cover of a 1975 recording of Richard Strauss’s “Ein Heldenleben”.</p>\n<p>“I hated the image of the omnipotent, God-like fucker who flies his private jet around the world, and dates supermodels and so on — this is an image that is totally normal for a rock star and nobody would even question it, but I thought, ‘Do we really need this on our side of the fence?’ ”</p>\n<p>And how about now, I ask? “Well, obviously my position is somewhat compromised,” he replies, without elaboration, “and speaking of Karajan, I’m a big fan of his, now more than ever.”</p>\n<p><span class=\"ft-bold\">. . .</span>\n</p>\n<p>In 1983, when he was just 25, Salonen was asked to replace the eminent American conductor Michael Tilson Thomas at short notice and conducted the Philharmonia in a dazzling performance of Mahler’s Third Symphony. “I was the last one they called,” he insists. “Come on — some guy in Finland? They were in a desperate situation.” But this is how stars are born, and within two years he was made chief conductor of the Swedish Radio Symphony Orchestra.</p>\n<p>It was not until 1996 that Salonen produced his first major composition — LA Variations — a lush orchestral work commissioned by the LA Philharmonic. I want to know what sparked this sudden creativity — did it come down to geography, a sense of escape from the conventions of European modernism? “Yeah, like killing your father,” he says deadpan, “Oedipal, ultimate action . . . And there were other more obvious factors, too, I was getting older and I was happy. Things had settled down.”</p>\n<aside data-asset-type=\"pullQuote\" data-asset-name=\"asset3\"></aside><p>Since then his output has been prolific, and he now divides his year, five months to seven, between conducting and composing. In September, he celebrated his appointment as inaugural creative chair for the Zurich Tonhalle Orchestra with the premiere of a new work, Karawane, inspired by dadaism and, in particular, Hugo Ball’s 1916 poem of the same name. “It’s written in a nonsense language but it’s a combination of five or six European languages, including Swedish, and it may or may not describe a circus caravan moving from one place to another,” he explains, “there’s this Gestalt called Jolifanto, a kind of happy elephant, a joli-plant, and they say, ‘Blago bung’ . . . ”</p>\n<p>Just as I’m beginning to feel a little out of my depth, the waiter reappears. Salonen asks for coffee, no pudding, but our double espressos arrive with a paper-lined tin filled with miniature lemon and poppyseed madeleines and jagged slices of peanut brittle, which we snap into pieces and nibble.</p>\n<p>I mention a recently published report by Sound and Music, a UK agency for new music, which claims the average fee per commission for composers in 2013 was just £1,392. “In terms of monetary compensation for compositions, it has gone to hell,” he says. Part of the problem, he says, is the assumption that intellectual property belongs to the employer. “So, if you compare this to the situation of composers, OK, it looks strange, but what people don’t understand is that the money involved is extremely small. For instance, if I count my own hours for Karawane versus the commissioning money, I don’t come up to the UK minimum wage — nowhere near — I mean, I’m OK because I can whip up some noise,” he adds.</p>\n<p>Which brings us to his very public endorsement of Apple. The advert shows Salonen whistling an inspired phrase, a kernel of his award-winning Violin Concerto, then composing fragments of the piece in taxis and airport lounges. “This is such an obscure profession, and what we do is so often misrepresented by the media as some sort of hopeless thing for fat rich people, so I thought, ‘My 30 seconds in the mainstream, I’d cherish them,’ ” he says. So did it earn him a lifetime of free Apple products? “No. By no means,” he replies, with that awkward half-smile, and then neatly shuts me down. “In the lingo it was not even called a commercial, it was called a ‘user testimony’, and I’ve been advised to direct all questions of that kind to my representatives.”</p>\n<p>I shift to the less tricky subject of the London Philharmonia. Salonen rhapsodises about the orchestra (he met his wife there) and the discussion leads to his fears for the future of music-making. While there are some fine instrumentalists emerging, he says, and an exceptional crop of young conductors, he is concerned about a vacuum of talent in music management. “The old generation of managers, and those dealing with arts councils and US labour markets, they are going to retire in the next five to 10 years and where are the new ones?”</p>\n<p>With the current financial cuts, he says, there is a desperate need for focus and direction in the arts. “There’s this ostrich mentality that you bury your head in the sand, and you put your ass up in the air, and you think you’re somehow safe, and that’s the worst possible approach. When things start shaking, we are utterly unprepared,” he says rather ominously, before we switch back to preparations for the festival’s opening night. “I must get ready, find my tails and stuff.”</p>\n<p>I glance around for the bill. “You OK with this?” he adds, as he hastens towards the door.</p>\n<p><span class=\"ft-italic\"></span>\n<span class=\"ft-italic\">Illustration by James Ferguson</span>\n</p>"},"lifecycle":{"initialPublishDateTime":"2014-12-05T15:25:38Z","lastPublishDateTime":"2014-12-05T15:25:38Z"},"location":{"uri":"http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/7803a998-7aeb-11e4-8646-00144feabdc0.html"},"summary":{"excerpt":"Over king crab in Stockholm, the Finnish conductor-composer talks about Baltic heavy metal bands, starring in an iPad ad and why classical music should be at the centre of political debate"},"packaging":{"spHeadline":"Esa-Pekka Salonen"},"master":{"masterSource":"Methode","masterEntityId":"7803a998-7aeb-11e4-8646-00144feabdc0"},"editorial":{"subheading":"Over king crab salad, the Finnish conductor-composer talks about heavy metal and why classical music should be at the centre of political debate","standFirst":"Over king crab in Stockholm, the Finnish conductor-composer talks about Baltic heavy metal bands, starring in an iPad ad and why classical music should be at the centre of political debate","byline":"Laura Battle"},"provenance":{"originatingParty":"FT"},"usage":{"publications":[{"name":"FT Weekend","id":"RlRXZWVrZW5k-UHVibGljYXRpb24="},{"name":"FT.com","id":"RlQuY29t-UHVibGljYXRpb24="}]},"metadata":{"primarySection":{"term":{"name":"Life & Arts","id":"MTQ4-U2VjdGlvbnM=","attributes":[],"taxonomy":"sections"}},"tags":[{"term":{"name":"Life & Arts","id":"MTQ4-U2VjdGlvbnM=","attributes":[],"taxonomy":"sections"}},{"term":{"name":"Lunch with the FT","id":"QnJhbmRzXzEwOQ==-QnJhbmRz","attributes":[],"taxonomy":"brand"}},{"term":{"name":"Features","id":"NGQ2MWQ0NDMtMDc5Mi00NWExLTlkMGQtNWZhZjk0NGExOWU2-R2VucmVz","attributes":[],"taxonomy":"genre"}},{"term":{"name":"Text","id":"ZjMwY2E2NjctMDA1Ni00ZTk4LWI0MWUtZjk5MTk2ZTMyNGVm-TWVkaWFUeXBlcw==","attributes":[],"taxonomy":"mediaType"}}],"authors":[{"term":{"name":"Laura Battle","id":"Q0ItMDAwMTIxNA==-QXV0aG9ycw==","attributes":[],"taxonomy":"authors"}}],"brand":[{"term":{"name":"Lunch with the FT","id":"QnJhbmRzXzEwOQ==-QnJhbmRz","attributes":[],"taxonomy":"brand"}}],"genre":[{"term":{"name":"Features","id":"NGQ2MWQ0NDMtMDc5Mi00NWExLTlkMGQtNWZhZjk0NGExOWU2-R2VucmVz","attributes":[],"taxonomy":"genre"}}],"icb":[],"iptc":[{"term":{"name":"01011000 -
