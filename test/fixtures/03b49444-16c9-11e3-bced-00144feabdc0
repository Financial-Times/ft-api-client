But he plans to address the American people on Tuesday to put his case for military intervention after the Assad regime allegedly killed more than 1,400 people in a chemical weapons attack in the eastern suburbs of Damascus on August 21.</p>\n<p>“Gassing innocent people, delivering chemical weapons against children is not something we do,” Mr Obama said at a post-summit press conference. “It’s prohibited in active wars between countries, even more so against children, and we’ve got to stand up for that principle.”</p>\n<p>He acknowledged that he might not win the votes in Congress, where opposition to his military plan is particularly strong in the Republican-controlled House of Representatives. “I knew this was going to be a heavy lift,” he said.</p>\n<p>Mr Obama said the G20 leaders were unanimous that chemical weapons had been used and that international norms against them had to be maintained. He said the “majority of the room” agreed with Washington that the Assad regime was responsible for their use but acknowledged that there was resistance to action without UN Security Council authorisation.</p>\n<p>The White House later released a joint statement backing US action on behalf of the leaders of Australia, Canada, France, Italy, Japan, South Korea, Saudi Arabia, Spain, Turkey and the UK.</p>\n<p>“The world cannot wait for endless failed processes that can only lead to increased suffering in Syria and regional instability,” the statement said. “We support efforts undertaken by the United States and other countries to reinforce the prohibition on the use of chemical weapons.” </p>\n<p>Vladimir Putin, Russia’s president, who is a longtime ally of <a title=\"Syria crisis in depth - FT.com\" href=\"http://www.ft.com/indepth/syria-crisis\">Syria</a> and has repeatedly blocked UN action against Mr Assad, said after the summit that the majority of countries opposed a US-led strike. He repeated his view that such intervention would be “a provocation” and said Russia would support Syria in the event of a US attack.</p>\n<p>“We are already helping it now, we are supplying weapons there and co-operating in the economic sector and I hope there will be more co-operation in the humanitarian field, including in supplying humanitarian aid to provide support to those civilians who have found themselves in a very difficult situation in this country,” he said.</p>\n<aside data-asset-type=\"pullQuote\" data-asset-name=\"asset1\"></aside><p>The two leaders said they had discussed Syria for 20 minutes on Thursday night on the sidelines of the summit and effectively agreed to disagree on military intervention.</p>\n<p><a title=\"UK gives extra £52m in Syria aid - FT.com\" href=\"http://www.ft.com/intl/cms/s/0/f6e04630-16c5-11e3-9ec2-00144feabdc0.html\">David Cameron</a>, the UK prime minister, said after the summit that the advocates of intervention had had “by far the better of the argument”. But he admitted that conquering public opinion was proving tough: “Clearly there’s a great deal of scepticism on how to help with this Syrian conflict.”</p>\n<p>Mr Obama accepted that he still had to convince many Americans and their representatives in Congress of the need for military intervention and the nature of the strike he is proposing.</p>\n<aside data-asset-type=\"promoBox\" data-asset-name=\"asset2\"></aside><p>“One of the biggest concerns of the American people is understanding that what we’re describing here would be limited, proportionate and designed to address this chemical weapons use and uphold a norm that keeps all of us safe,” he said.</p>\n<p>The president repeatedly declined to say what he would do if Congress did not vote to intervene.</p>\n<p>Earlier on Friday, Tony Blinken, Mr Obama’s deputy national security adviser, told National Public Radio that Mr Obama had the right to act without congressional approval “but it’s neither his desire nor his intention to use that authority absent of Congress backing him”.</p>\n<p>The US has ordered non-essential diplomats out of Lebanon “due to potential threats to US mission facilities and personnel” and advised against all non-essential travel to the country. Washington also authorised the removal of non-essential staff from its consulate general in Adana, a Turkish city near the Syrian border.</p>\n<p>Xi Jinping, China’s president, told Mr Obama in a bilateral meeting that “a political solution is the only right way out for the Syrian crisis and a military strike cannot solve the problem from the root”, according to China’s Xinhua news agency.</p>\n<p>“We expect certain countries to have a second thought before action,” Mr Xi reportedly added.</p>"
