Pre-tax profit in Barclays’ investment bank decreased to £284m from £465m in the same period last year.</p>\n<p>Mr Jenkins said: “The investment bank’s performance in the quarter was disappointing, but we have been able to offset that within the rebalanced group and still deliver good core performance.”</p>\n<p>Revenues rose 1 per cent year-on-year in the three months to September. The <a title=\"Banks must cut costs but remember what their customers want - www.ft.com\" href=\"http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/a3fbfd2e-5873-11e4-942f-00144feab7de.html\">benefits of restructuring</a>, including a reduction of 7,800 jobs in the past year, helped to reduce operating expenses by almost 7 per cent.</p>\n<p>The decline in investment banking was mainly driven by a 13 per cent fall in revenues from its markets business, which was hit by a drop in credit and equities trading. That contrasts with many of its rivals, which have recently reported a rally in fixed income trading.</p>\n<p>Mr Morzaria said a lawsuit by New York’s financial regulator over Barclays’ anonymous “dark pool” trading venue had impacted equity trading and contributed to a drop in investment banking revenue. Barclays has filed a motion to dismiss the case.</p>\n<p>He added that since Barclays shrank the more complex credit trading operations of its investment bank in a restructuring it announced in May, it missed out on a recent rally in areas such as distressed debt, structured products and emerging markets debt in the past quarter.</p>\n<p>Elsewhere, growth in quarterly profits from the personal and corporate bank as well as Barclaycard was partially offset by a fall at its Africa business.</p>\n<p>Earnings per share fell from 3.8p to 2.4p in the quarter. The cost-income ratio was flat at 70 per cent, well above many rivals, but the common equity tier one ratio – an important measure of financial strength – rose from 9.9 per cent to 10.2 per cent in the quarter.</p>\n<p>“This is our third consecutive lowest cost quarter and is in fact our lowest cost quarter for five years,” said Mr Morzaria.</p>\n<p>The bank said its leverage ratio rose slightly to 3.5 per cent, above the minimum required of 3 per cent. But it could face pressure to increase it much further when the Bank of England publishes its new standard for the measure on Friday, when it is expected to set a new floor of between 4 per cent and 5 per cent.</p>\n<p>Mr Morzaria said the bank had hit its objective for a leverage ratio of 3.5 per cent a year ahead of target. “I feel very confident that our ability to manage leverage is very good,” he said, adding: “Hopefully the momentum we have got here will stand us in good stead for whatever is announced tomorrow.”</p>\n<p>Chirantan Barua, analyst at Bernstein, said: “We see third-quarter results as a clear indication of a deleveraging investment bank under significant pressure. Leverage ratios at the end of the week could be crucial for the sustainability of this business.”</p>\n<p>Barclays is one of six institutions that have been meeting the UK’s Financial Conduct Authority to thrash out the details of a so-called global settlement to the watchdog’s probe into the forex market that could come as soon as next month.</p>\n<p>The other banks are UBS, Citigroup, HSBC, JPMorgan Chase and Royal Bank of Scotland. Several of those lenders – including UBS and JPMorgan – have already put money aside to cover the cost of a likely settlement with regulators for alleged wrongdoing.</p>"
